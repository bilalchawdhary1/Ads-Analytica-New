  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "1. What is the difference between web design and web development?",
      "answer": "Answer: Web design focuses on the aesthetics and user experience of a website, including layout, color schemes, and graphics. Web development, on the other hand, involves the coding and programming needed to bring the design to life and ensure the website functions smoothly. While design is about how the website looks, development is about how the website works."
    },
    {
      "question": "2. How long does it take to build a website?",
      "answer": "Answer: The timeline for building a website depends on the complexity of the project. A simple website might take 4-6 weeks, while more complex sites with custom features, e-commerce, or extensive content might take several months. We work with you to set a realistic timeline based on your needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "3. Will my website be mobile-friendly?",

    },
    {
      "question": "7. How much does a website cost?",
