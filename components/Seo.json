    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "1. What is SEO and why is it important?",
        "answer": "Answer: SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of optimizing your website to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) like Google. It helps increase the visibility of your site, driving more traffic and potential customers to your business. Without SEO, your site may not reach its full audience."
      },
      {
        "question": "2. How long does it take to see results from SEO?",
        "answer": "Answer: SEO is a long-term strategy. While you may begin to see improvements within 3 to 6 months, significant results can take 6-12 months depending on the competitiveness of your industry and the SEO tactics implemented."
      },
      {
        "question": "3. What’s the difference between organic and paid results?",
        "answer": " Answer: Organic results are the listings that appear due to their relevance to the search term, without paying for placement. Paid results (often in the form of ads) appear at the top or bottom of SERPs, and businesses pay for every click or impression."
      },
      {
        "question": "4 What are keywords and why are they important?",
        "answer": "Answer: Keywords are the search terms people type into search engines. By targeting the right keywords, we ensure your website appears when users search for products or services you offer. Choosing the right keywords can drive more qualified traffic to your website."
      },
      {
        "question": "5.  Do I need to change my website to rank better in search engines?",
        "answer": "In some cases, yes. We may recommend structural changes, content optimization, and improving your website's load speed to meet SEO best practices. These improvements can enhance your chances of ranking higher."
      },
      {
        "question": "6. What is on-page SEO?",
        "answer": "Answer: On-page SEO refers to optimizing individual web pages to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic. This involves updating content, optimizing HTML elements (like title tags and meta descriptions), and ensuring your site is mobile-friendly."
      },
      {
        "question": "7. What is off-page SEO?",
        "answer": "Answer: Off-page SEO focuses on actions taken outside your website to improve your rankings. This includes strategies like link building, social media marketing, and influencer outreach. Building backlinks from authoritative websites is a key part of off-page SEO."
      },
      {
        "question": "8. What is Local SEO?",
        "answer": "Answer: Local SEO is focused on optimizing your online presence to attract business from local searches on Google. This is crucial for businesses that operate on a local level, such as restaurants or service-based businesses. Optimizing your Google My Business profile is a part of local SEO."
      },
      {
        "question": "9.How do backlinks affect my site’s ranking?",
        "answer": "Answer: Backlinks are links from other websites that point to your site. Search engines view these as a vote of confidence in your content. High-quality backlinks from reputable sites can significantly improve your website's authority and ranking in search results."
      },
      {
        "question": "10. Do you provide monthly reports?",
        "answer": "Answer: Yes, we provide detailed monthly reports that highlight key performance indicators, keyword rankings, organic traffic improvements, and future strategy plans. This ensures complete transparency of our SEO efforts."
